# printfiles
Various neat models for 3D printing I've made

## Precompiled .gcode files
The included .gcode files are compiled using the config for the Anycubic Kobra 2 Neo. In the somewhat likely case that the included G-code files do not work with your printer, you should use your own slicer. 

Most of the models included can be scaled to any size, but if not the measurements will be included in the model folder's read me file.
